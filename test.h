		<p>Hello my name Angela Gomez, this is my second year at Dallas College.</p>
		<p>The reason that I am taking this class is that it is one of the requirements for my major.</p>
		<p>I took Computer Programming in highschool for two years.</p>
		<p>Unfortuanately it's been a while since I have used it, so I am a little lost.</p>
		<p>I really enjoy to bake and read in my free time, and I love Art especially 3D Art.</p>
